## Name

S&P 500 Oracle

## Netuid

## Description

Overview: The Foundry S&P 500 Oracle incentivizes miners to frequently predict the S&P 500 price index during trading hours (9:30 AM - 4 PM.) We chose to integrate traditional financial markets and the Bittensor network to expose Bittensor, a decentralized system to the largest system in the world; the global economy. The S&P 500 model serves as a suitable starting point for financial predictions given the indexâ€™s utility, accessibility, and world-wide acceptance. 

The Mechanism at-work: Validators send miners a timestamp, or future time, for which the miners must  make an S&P 500 price prediction. The miners must immediately respond with their price prediction at that given time. Validators then store these predictions, and calculate the scores of the miners once the predictions mature. Miners then receive ranks to stack up against one another, naturally incentivizing competition.
